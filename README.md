# React ES6+JSX+LESS Learning Project

The technology stack used in the project:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) — a virtual DOM JavaScript library for rendering UI.  It's about rendering view as a function of state, making JavaScript-driven UI declarative the way HTML is declarative.
- [Webpack 2](https://gist.github.com/sokra/27b24881210b56bbaff7) and [webpack dev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) — client-side module builder and dev server that serves the app.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) — package manager
- [Babel 6](http://babeljs.io/) — transpiler from ES6 / JSX to ES5, which is supported by all browsers
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/) — Less is a CSS pre-processor
